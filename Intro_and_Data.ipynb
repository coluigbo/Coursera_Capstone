    "##### Grocery retailers face increasing competition not only from other brick-and-mortar stores but also increasingly from on-line retailers. Specifically, retailers in highly cosmopolitanism urban centers like Toronto, Ontario face additional challenges trying to maximize revenue from an increasingly diverse demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### While on-line retailers face very few limits in the variety of merchandise they can display, their brick and mortar counterparts are limited by the availability of valuable shelf space. The impact of rapidly rising real estate prices on the cost of setting up grocery stores makes the idea of putting a brand-new big-box grocery store in places like Toronto almost impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### The implication of the foregoing is that while retail square footage is getting smaller, there is also a corresponding increase in the variety of merchandise required to maximize revenue from the changed demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Information from the 2016 census suggests that roughly half of Toronto residents were born outside of Canada. However, this distribution is quite clustered. People from similar ethnicities prefer to live together in similar neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### In this project, we analyze these neighborhoods and try to discover how we can use the concentration of restaurants, (some of which are ethnic focused) combined with demographic information from the 2016 census to discern the demographic mix of different neighborhoods and use this to build a better focused merchandising mix for different neighborhoods. While the census data shows how Torontonians identify themselves demographically, the restaurant information gives a more dynamic view of the influences and tastes that may shape their actual grocery shopping behavior.\n",

    "### Target Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who would benefit from this project?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ##### Existing national grocery chains that want to change their merchandising mix to better target customers in different   neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ##### New grocery chains who are looking to design a merchandising strategy that reflects the differing neighborhood \tdemographics in Toronto, Ontario.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ##### Entrepreneurs looking at establishing ethnic focused grocery stores\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ##### Marketers who work for the grocery industry and will like to better target their direct marketing and other location based advertising to better reflect local requirements.\n",

This shows the ethnic origin groups with 7% of more of population in each riding, (highest % for each ethnic group as well the most populous ethnic group in a riding).

We parse the resulting JSON file and obtain a Dataframe showing restaurants in each neighborhood. We apply One Hot Encoding to obtain the occurrence of different categories of restaurant in each neighborhood. Next, we group the rows by neighborhood and by taking the mean of the frequency of occurrence of each category, we now get the following Dataframe\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using the K-means Clustering algorithm to segment Toronto neighbourhoods using demographics and the type of restaurants found in the neighbourhood. K-means clustering is one of the simplest unsupervised machine learning algorithms and is especially popular for data segmentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm partitions the neighbourhoods into a certain number (k) of clusters. It achieves this by randomly initiating k points (called centroids) at random locations and slowly fit each data-point to the nearest centroid. Each data-point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into distinct cells. The K-Means algorithm minimizes intra-cluster variances (measured as squared Euclidean distances), while maximizing inter-cluster variance."
