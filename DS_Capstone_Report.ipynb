    "Grocery retailers face increasing competition not only from other brick-and-mortar stores but also increasingly from on-line retailers. Specifically, retailers in highly cosmopolitanism urban centers like Toronto, Ontario face additional challenges trying to maximize revenue from an increasingly diverse demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "While on-line retailers face very few limits in the variety of merchandise they can display, their brick and mortar counterparts are limited by the availability of valuable shelf space. The impact of rapidly rising real estate prices on the cost of setting up grocery stores makes the idea of putting a brand-new big-box grocery store in places like Toronto almost impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implication of the foregoing is that while retail square footage is getting smaller, there is also a corresponding increase in the variety of merchandise required to maximize revenue from the changed demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information from the 2016 census suggests that roughly half of Toronto residents were born outside of Canada. However, this distribution is quite clustered. People from similar ethnicities prefer to live together in similar neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyze these neighborhoods and try to discover how we can use the concentration of restaurants, (some of which are ethnic focused) combined with demographic information from the 2016 census to discern the demographic mix of different neighborhoods and use this to build a better focused merchandising mix for different neighborhoods. While the census data shows how Torontonians identify themselves demographically, the restaurant information gives a more dynamic view of the influences and tastes that may shape their actual grocery shopping behavior.\n",

    "Who would benefit from this project?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2. New grocery chains who are looking to design a merchandising strategy that reflects the differing neighborhood \tdemographics in Toronto, Ontario.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Entrepreneurs looking at establishing ethnic focused grocery stores\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Marketers who work for the grocery industry and will like to better target their direct marketing and other location based advertising to better reflect local requirements.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using the K-means Clustering algorithm to segment Toronto neighbourhoods using demographics and the type of restaurants found in the neighbourhood. K-means clustering is one of the simplest unsupervised machine learning algorithms and is especially popular for data segmentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm partitions the neighbourhoods into a certain number (k) of clusters. It achieves this by randomly initiating k points (called centroids) at random locations and slowly fit each data-point to the nearest centroid. Each data-point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into distinct cells. The K-Means algorithm minimizes intra-cluster variances (measured as squared Euclidean distances), while maximizing inter-cluster variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining our Features Dataframe, we find that we have 112 features. We do a correlation heatmap to examine any correlations in features.\n",
    "\n",
    "![TO Food and Demographics Heatmap](TO_Dem_FoodHeatmap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the large number of features, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to limit the number of features. This according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we are not sure of the optimal number of components. We make a plot of the percentage of explained variance against the number of features (components).\n",
    "\n",
    "![TO PCA Features](TO_PCA_Features.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that we are able to capture most of the variance in the data after 10 components. So we will use a PCA with 10 components\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the PCA with 10 components, we try to find the optimal number of clusters for our *k-means clustering* We do this by plotting  the number of clusters against the inertia.\n",
    "\n",
    "![TO Optimal K means](TO_Optimal_K_Means.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that after 6 clusters the inertia more or less drops off. We therefore run *k*-means to cluster the neighborhood into 6 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then create a new dataframe that includes the cluster labels as well as the top 5 venues and top 5 ethnicities for each neighborhood.\n",

    "Looking at the clusters, we find that of the 2 largest clusters, one is predominantly English and Canadian while the other one is more diverse. This means that in planning a merchandising strategy, we the English/Canadian neighborhood cluster will have a less ethnically diverse merchandising than the other ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cities around the world are getting more diverse and retailers face significant obstacles to serving this increasingly diverse population in an optimal manner. This exercise attempts to illustrate how retailers may attempt to segment possible store locations based on demographics and the type of restaurants (as an indicator of local color). \n",
    "\n",
    "The results are instructive and represents a good initial approach to customizing merchandising to fit different locations. This method may be supplemented by other techniques including in-store data gathering to further customize retail offerings.  "
